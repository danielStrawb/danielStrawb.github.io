		<h1>Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc</h1>
		
		<p>Is this another visual novel? Yes, but there is something unique to Danganronpa, than usual games in this genre. Comparing it to Katawa Shoujo or Doki-Doki, I'd rather compare it to Persona. To be honest. I have never completed any of these games, unlike Danganronpa.</p>
		
		<p>I am really excited, how they are to combine 3D, and 2D pixel art pictures, and put them into a detective, visual novel, shooter and dating simulator.</p>
		
		<p>The main character is Makoto Naegi, the <strong>Ultimate (un)Lucky Student</strong>, who is just an ordinary guy, who is invited to <strong>Hope's Peak Academy</strong> along with other Ultimate Students.</p>
		
		<p>All of these characters were made to inspire you. While I play this video game, I learn some important life lessons throught dialogues, become more self-controlled, or simply find love :D</p>
		
		<p>Their stories are truly inspiring.</p>
		
		<p>In a few days, I will start living on my own, studying at an academy, and sharing an apartments with two friends. I understand that co-living can be a good idea, as long as everyone else has their own space and freedom.</p>
		
		<p>This is an hour full of fascinating stories... This is <strong>Danganronpa!</strong></p>
