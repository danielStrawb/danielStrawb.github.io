		<h1>The Garden of Words (2013)</h1>
		
		<p>Recently, i watch anime called "The Garden of Words" (Kotonoha no Niwa), that been released in 2013, and directed by Makoto Shinkai.</p>
		<p>I found it the same day, when i was surfing MyAnimeList for some lite for understanding anime in ganre of "Slice of Life".</p>
		<p>It's duration really short, just 45 minuites, and in fact, it's really sad, becuase i want to dive into this beautiful world for a little longer time...</p>
		<p>Story tells about a completely spontaneous meeting of Takao and Yukari. Maybe it's looks like really simple story, but even here it's shows yourself as philisophical idea of loneliness, and love.</p>
		<p>Their meeting place - it's garden, and every time it's raining, they are meet each others in the bower.</p>
		<p>Throught the story, they are reading two poems from Man'yōshū. (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves)</p>
		<p>Definitely, this anime deserves to give him attention. It fascinates me that when the anime shows the credits, viewer thinks it's an anime with open ending, but if we are watch to the end, we will see, that the real ending answers a lot of questions.</p>
