    <h1>Guide for independency from big corporations</h1>
    <p>Before i have three articles, that have almost the same topic - human independecy in today's world. So, let's look at some examples, why you should do this, and how</p>
    
    <h1>Why it's important?</h1>
    
    <h2>YouTube</h2>
    <p>Youtube every year become worse. Maybe all knows about problems of "Trending" page, but lat's talk about other thing - dominant content on this platform. Every day creators make terabytes of content, some of them is really useful, or just interesting, and some idiotc, like Elsagate, that cannot make your kid better, it's only give them wish to become part of consuming culture, and ask you to buy CocaCola/PepsiCola, and Chips (every family can make it yourself from 2-3 potatos and get a lot more and healthier, than you got from a few packs, that cost not so small money), and other snacks. I can say only one- parents should teach their kid'sm not strangers form YouTube, because from Internet kid can only degenerate in this age. YouTube don't show human all, that thei parents can. As example, my mother give me possability to help cooking, i peel potatos or carrots with not dangerous knife, and in this way i improve myself physically and have a good time. If my parents cannt be with me, they are give me to my grandmother and grandfather, that also show me a lot of interesting things. If you have enough time, you can teach your kids a lot of things, and they are know important things before school, as my classmate, that in kindergarden can read and write, because he's mother being teacher. So we shouldn't give this industy progression. You also can found a lot of agressive content, where peoples talk about others for hours, throwing this agression in the void, waisting your time.</p>
                
    <h2>Tik-Tok</h2>
    <p>The worst social media, because it's destroy you from inside, you cannot concentrate, you can consume a lot of videos, and don't understand this, you make you life worse with this source of bad dophamine. This social media have no alternatives, just drop this as faster, as you can, i happy, that never have account on it, and don't want all this, i need only understand, what i need, not bad dophamine.</p>
    
    <h2>MindGeek</h2>
    <p>If you ask me to name the worst company, i said - MindGeek, it's company, that make money on your addictions, and make from your instincts addiction. All popular pornsites - it's owned by MindGeek, maybe you said, that almost all of them free to use, but it's not plus, because they are give your mental problems progression, you start to feel, that you want something more, than just sex, you start to buy paid subscribtion, you pay to models, and can search videos for hours. You dismotivated.  You don't need all this, our society don't need all this, and now it's hard to find peoples, that you love, because all found alternative in porn. You can read more about this <a href="https://denshi.org/antiporn">here</a>. If you have problem with this, start to beat it now.</p>

    <p>P.S about erotic: erotic too provided to you by big corporations, you buy or watch this at OnlyFans, or other sites like this, so you invest into this industry progresstion. The real erotc - it's art, and i cannot said this about porn, so see in erotic art, not source of feelings, and support independent industry!</p>

    <h2>Facebook. Twitter, instagram</h2>
    <p>It's way of social control, if you have possability, delete your accounts, all this websites are bloated, control your time, and don't give possability to create, only consume. I don't hate artists, that post he's works on this media, but it's being better, if they are have personal blog, where you don't need to connect to a lot of trackers to just view image, if you have contact with them, recommend this alternative, maybe they are see in this something good. So, for today a lot of artists have personal website, and with every year it's more and more. Yes, we have some progression in industry of Internet. When you drop all this, you see, how much time being waste on something useless, that you can live without.</p>
                
    <p>You can read this <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/internet-culture/how-to-delete-instagram-facebook-online-accounts/">blog</a> post from Mozilla, to understand more about deleting social media accounts.</p>
    
    <h2>Fastfood</h2>
    <p>As person from countryside, i eat fastfood only one time in life, but i understand how big this industry. This food not healthy, and every time, you buy some burger, you should understand, that this meat of killed animal. As i know, to kill animals on farm, peoples use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_bolt_pistol">Captive Bolt Pistol</a>, just try to undertsnad, how this is, feel, that you have bolt inside your brain, before die with a lot of pain. We shouldn't kill so much animals, we should love them, and drop this awful industry, you can make food yourself, it's being cheeper, and more healthy. I also know, that this industry connected with CocaCola, and PepsiCo(la), so they are make peoples feel bad together. Wendy's, McDonalds, KFC, Burger King, and that's only the most popular examples.</p>
    
    <h2>OpenAI and ChatGPT</h2>
    <p>2023 - it's the year of AI technology, almost on every kilometer of Internet you see news and articles about AI, but is this so useful? Honestly, i never use AI to do some work, only try this websites, that generate image, and i don't need it. Anyway, if you use it, i recommend you to use offline alternatives, like <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama">LlaMa</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>WhatsApp, Telegram</h2>
    <p>Why do you need a few the same applications on one device? It's not only takes your power, but also make you addicted to smartphone, because you cannot use full functional of applications on PC. Isn't easier to use SMS and MMS, if your friends is connected to one operator. Now a lot of operators give you unlimited SMS, but peoples don't use it, and prefare bloted alternatives, like official Telegram client, that every year become more and more closed. Also, in context of offline work, your SMS messages always availible on device, and can be exported.</p>
    
    <h2>News sites</h2>
    <p>you see only propaganda, politic, and bad news, that dismotivate, you don't read news, you read junk, that don't required by minimal life, i read only one news-site, news site about opensource, so i read that thing, that interesting to me, and i don't care of world's propaganda.</p>
    
    <h2>Fox, Paramount, Universal Pictures, Warner Music Group, Sony Music</h2>
    <p>Interesting thing, but maybe you see, that almost all music and movies is owned by this corporations. It's hard to found independent works now, and maybe, it's not so hard to watch this movies and listen to this music, but remember peoples, that being sacrifice of this industry:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>John Belushi - talanted actor, that have drug addiction, and died of overdose, HollyWood do nothing to help him, they are have profit from them, and use it.</li>
        <li>Kurt Cobain - Suicide, by the official theory, he is die, because of mental problems, problems with wife, and he is don't like popularity, that he got only from one album.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Nirvana and Belushi being like brend, not peoples like we are, they are as product, that peoples buy and sell.</p>

    <h1>Ways to become independent</h1>
    
    <h2>Google</h2>
    <p>Supporting Google - it's supporting not only domination in search engines, but also other services like eMail, video hosting. This company makes so much to make you depend on it's, and see every person use it. The best, that you can do - it's store your personal data on local storages:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>external HDD,</li>
        <li>USB flash drive</li>
        <li>physical storages, like books, and notepads</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>YouTube</h2>
    <p>After you are copy all your data to one of this storages, now we should change our YouTube channels and playlists, and i have a few good ways:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Invidious</li>
        <li>Piped</li>
        <li>youtube-dl</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I try all of this methods, and can say, that the best way, it's download videos to your HDD with youtube-dl, because it's minimal way. But, maybe not for all. I use YouTube last years rather as archive of my favorite channels and live perforamnces, musical videos, but maybe you are use it for fun, so i recommend use software like <a href="https://freetubeapp.io/">FreeTube</a> for computer, and <a href="https://github.com/libre-tube/LibreTube">LibreTube</a> for Android.</p>
    <p>if you wanna to download YouTube channels, i use command like this:</p>
    
    <details>
        <code>
            yt-dlp --geo-bypass --yes-playlist --write-description --write-thumbnail --write-subs --sub-format srt  -o "%(uploader)s/%(playlist)s/%(upload_date)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s" -f 'bestvideo+bestaudio' --prefer-ffmpeg --download-archive .archive.txt {url}
        </code>
    </details>
    
    <p>and this for playlists:</p>
    
    <details>
        <code>
            yt-dlp --geo-bypass --yes-playlist --write-description --write-thumbnail --write-subs --sub-format srt  -o "%(uploader)s/%(playlist)s/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s" -f 'bestvideo+bestaudio' --prefer-ffmpeg --download-archive .archive.txt {url}
        </code>
    </details>
    
    <p>After, you have a very good strustured directory with your favorite Youtube videos!</p>
    <p>I also have a <a href="../images/youtubealternative.jpg">meme</a>, that can help find you the best alternative to YouTube. :D</p>
    
    <h2>Websites</h2>
    <p>It's great to have websites on hard drive, to acess interesting and important information without Internet-connection. Not all websites can be download with full functional, but you can use wget for this:</p>
    
    <details>
        <code>
            wget --tries 10 -N --continue --progres=bar --force-directories --no-check-certificate --recursive --convert-links --mirror --page-requisites --strict-comments --execute robots="off" {url}
        </code>
    </details>
    
    <p>Also, you can add <code>-i ./websites.txt</code>, to download a few websites in one command, but sometimes it can cause a little problems with link redirect.</p>
    
    <h2>Web Browser</h2>
    <p>If you are using all your websites locally, so i think you can don't care about your browser. But anyway, if you want to have absolutley free and independent technology, you have a few options:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Ladybird</li>
        <li>Netsurf</li>
        <li>links</li>
        <li>lynx</li>
        <li>w3m</li>
        <li><q cite="http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/firefox">don’t browse the web and actually get some work done</q> - <a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/firefox">cat-v</a></li>

    </ul>
    <p>And few debloated solutions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Abrowser, IceCat, LibreWolf</li>
        <li>UnGoogled Chromium</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Personally, i am use standart FireFox, because it's installed as standart browser on almost every distribution.</p>
    
    <h2>Software</h2>
    <p>It's situative thing, because every of us have unique requirements from computer. Some have just web browser and video player, installed, or some have office, video editor, photo editor, and a lot of other software, so i can only give a few variants for all of us:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use distribution like Slackware, that have almost every library and dependancy you need</li>
        <li>Follow <a href="./debianrepo.html">this</a> guide to use Debian iso as software repository</li>
        <li>Store all software source code and it's dependancy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yes, all of this methods looks in some parts complicated, but this is the only ways i found of all time i use Unix. You also can use some of minimal distros, and just install on them LMMS, Blender, InkScape, GIMP, and other. Devuan "Desktop" iso image give you possability to install OS only with clear TTY, so follow my guide, to learn more, and find the best way for you.</p>
