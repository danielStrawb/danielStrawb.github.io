	<h1>Why you should stop watching TV</h1>
	<p>I think, that today - TV become the worst source of information, and here is a few reasons, why i think so.</p>
	
	<h2>Less and less interesting shows</h2>
	   <p>Starting from 2000's, or 90's, TV become a place for consuming information, that with time become more useless. Like example, TV in USSR have a lot of interesting shows, where scientist shows computers, and algorithms of it's work, and where computers being used, including videogames science, and school. But, i think now we are don't seen something like this, because every time, you watch TV, you see infinite serials and TV shows. In this time, 50% of all, what I see - it's 24/7 news with propaganda.</p>
	   
	<h2>Did we have solution?</h2>
	   <p>Now, almost every program on USSR TV being archived on YouTube, and other platfroms. So, I think you can download intersting shows from YouTube, and watch them on your TV, with a big display. Also, not only old things archived, a lot of today's show have uploaded on YouTube or other platforms, so you have choice. I think, it's easier to download all interesting to you, put it on USB flash drive, and watch on big screen, than watch a lot of commercial every 30 minuites, that in my situation can be for 15 minuites on almost every channel. Yes, it's crazy.</p>
	
	<h2>Other alternatives</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Remove all channels with useless information like news and serials</li>
		<li>Try to found another way of have fun, while you take a break, like sleeping</li>
		<li>Make some work done</li>
	</ul>
