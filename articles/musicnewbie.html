	<h1>Tips for newbies in music</h1>
	<p></p>
	
	<h2>Your own chords</h2>
	<p>You have more options to play music, than standart chords and notes. Like example, in song The Cranberries - Zombie, chords progression looks like this:</p>
	<pre>
	    E     C     G     F#
	e|-----|-----|-----|-----|
	B|-----|-----|-----|-----|
	G|-----|-----|-----|-----|
	D|--2--|--2--|-----|-----|
	A|--2--|--3--|--2--|-----|
	E|-----|-----|--3--|--2--|
	</pre>
	
	<p>Looks strange, if you really long play with standart open or barre chords, isn't? And this give your song unique sound. One reason, why this song look like this, it's that Dolores don't have so much knowledges as guitarist, because she is better at vocal. <strong>All simple is genius</strong></p>
	
	<p>That's the way of Alternative Rock, a lot of songs in this ganre have experiments like this. Some of artist add a new notes to standart chords, some plays "dead notes", and other experiments with arpeggio.</p>
	
	<h2>Tune guitar to E-Flat</h2>
	<p>In this way you strings live longer. As example, last time i change my strings being 4 January of 2023,i do this because i don't have other strings to change, and don't know, where i can buy new. So, the only thing, that can be uncomfortable in first time, that you need to play all one freth higher, but now i am don't have any problems with this, and make from this my specal thing, because sometimes it's boring, that almost in every song E Standart tuning. As Example, Queens of The Stone Age have C Standart tuning on all of theirs songs, and The Pretty Reckless have E-Flat on "Just Tonight".</p>
	
	<h2>Listen more to other ganres</h2>
	<p>As example, if you listen Alternative Rock, you also could try to listen more Classic Rock, Jazz, and other ganres, that can inspire you to experiment with sound.</p>
	
	<h2>Try to learn music by ear</h2>
	<p>When you are play some time with your instrument, it's good experiance to try learn it by ear, it's opens a new horizonts of music for you. I don't know, it's have sense to learn something very hard, or full songs. You just can teke some riff, or moment from song, and try to play it. I have articles, where i list more reasons to try this, and how to do it: <a href="./tabs.html">[1]</a> <a href="./learnMusicByEar.html">[2]</a></p>
