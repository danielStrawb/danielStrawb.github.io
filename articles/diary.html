		<p>02-11-2024: I am going to create a new website, because i need some time to break from blogging. I am not going to delete this website, but maybe i am archive it. Don't worry, if you are like my articles, i continue to make some posts, but now i need to take a break, and make some websites for myself, in my local environment, or just hvae fun with something other in this life. I post every new updates here! ^_^</p>
		
		<p>26-10-2024: Study at accademy is hard, since we are learning so much subjects, and most of them - Math. So, maybe it's a good idea to make something like a referance book. Try to make a digital concept, and write the most important, you learn in collage, school or accademy. Some of my classmates use a big notebooks, with colorful separators.</p>
		
		<p>Here is my plan of this referance book:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Contents</li>
			<li>Terms</li>
			<li>Basic Arithmetic</li>
			<li>Algebra</li>
			<li>Geometry</li>
			<li>Logic</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>It's a good way to remember some of the basics, before learning something complex and hard. Anyway, you don't need to write everything you learn, because not all is necessary.</p>
		
		<p>17-10-2024: Am i the only, who think, that today's music is overcomplicated? Like... Recently i listen to new Bring Me The Horizon album, and i just cannot concentrate while listening. As example, their collab with Underoath (a bulleT w/ my namE On) is pretty chaotic, so much sound effects, chaotic song structure... Just to compare, when i play something like Black Veil Brides - Knives and Pens, or even any emo-type song of 2010's, i can hear every instrument playing it's own role in a song structure, i hear guitars, i hear drums, even if it's something simple, it could be genius, like Skrillex did his albums, they are full of energy, but you also can hear how structured it is. Someone once said, that new Underoath songs is made with A.I, and it's really terrible to hear, i hope we will come back to simple music, without all this crazy production techniques...</p>
		
		<p>08-10-2024: Today we are have so many solutions to online-communication. Instant messangers - we have a lot. But, did someone try to chat with e-mail? Since IRC invented, people prefare fast and simple solutions. Chatting with e-mail, you can wait messages for weeks, but moment you've got reply, this is a good feeling. I talk with my friend from Germany with e-mail last year, and we are talk not so much, but our friendship still strong. Remember, like people in the past use mail boxes, to send messages to other side of some country? This been a really long messages, that you will waiting for months. Let's try some experiment: Maybe, you have some friends, who would like to chat on e-mail? :D</p>
		
		<p>01-10-2024: I already said this so many times, but i never stop saying - this website, it's just one of the best things i ever have in my life. I meet so much beautiful people, who write me on my email, or just in xmpp chat's (i've been really shocked, when people from Dig Deeper chat knows about my posts).</p>
		
		<p>This website save me so much times, when my health issues become a problem for me and my future, or when i lost important people.</p>
		
		<p>Even after going through love addiction, i am still working on this website, and i have so much plans for my future posts. Even if no one follows me, i am still making new updates.</p>
		
		<p>I love you, SO MUCH! &lt;3</p>
		
		<p>23-09-2024: I have some plans to write article about my methods of effective studying, maybe, i am also give some advice to people, who about to start living by yourself, since i am study at academy far away from home.</p>
		
		<p>17-09-2024: Since I started taking depressants, my barin isn't good at writing new articles. But, i have some ideas for future posts. This is really hard times for me, because i start fighting my love addiction, and can spend all the day lying on my bed just staring at the wall.
		
		I think about writing some short diary posts.</p>
		
		<p>22-08-2024: I'm about to start a new website diary! Since my website is born, i write so much chaotic posts, so why don't we start everything from the beginning?</p>
