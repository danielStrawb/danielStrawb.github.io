		<h1>my favorite games</h1>
		<p>I am not that kind of guys, who spend hours every days playing videogames, but anyway - during my life i found some, that describes my interests and personality. I hope you liked it.</p>
		
		<h2>Minetest</h2>
		<p>Minetest is a great game, based on the Minecraft concept. I love it so much! You can play with friends on different devices, but in the same worlds or servers. It has an official content database, so you can install mods directly from the game. The last reason to play it is that GNU <a href='https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-games.html'>recommends Minetest over Minecraft</a>. If you just want to build some castles or just play with friends, there's no better alternative, than Minetest!</p>
		
		<p>Minetest don't have a regular for Minecraft things, like mobs or redstone, but you can add everything with mods in a few seconds.</p>
		
		<p>If you are in searching for Minecraft-based experiance, try <a href='https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/'>VoxeLibre</a> modpack.</p>
		
		<h2>Need for Speed: Most Wanted, A Criterion Game</h2>
		<p>This not that kind of games with a good story line - no, endless optimization problems and DLC is troublesome, but I can forgive everything to relax and ride a few hours in this wonderful world. I still impressed, even after 10 years since release.</p>
		
		<h2>Pocket God</h2>
		<p>Classic mobile time-killer, can't say anything else. :D</p>
		
		<h2>Ballance (A Cyparade game)</h2>
		<p>One of my first games I've ever played. It turns 20 this year, but I will never forget this experience. It feels like I want to live right here, in this endless skies, as if this is what bring me back to my childhood.</p>
		
		<h2>RollerCoaster Tycoon</h2>
		<p>My friend showed me this game, and it's awesome! Yes, just build a Luna Park, and have fun, listen to cool MIDI music, make some challanges for yourself, and share maps with friends!</p>
