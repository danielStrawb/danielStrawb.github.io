		<h1>Independence in the digital world</h1>
		<p>We are live in the digital age, and we are use smartphone, computer, TV and other gadgets to simplify personal life, but sometimes we are losing control.</p>
		
		<h3>YouTube</h3>
		<p>Last years I cannot enjoy watching YouTube, and I find less and less interesting and useful content. YouTube has evolved from some fun place into a large commercial platform. Videos become a way more serious, and less funny.</p>
		
		<p>But the same time, it's become more addictive, to just wasting time watching some videos to just fill background.</p>
	
		<p>I find some simple hack, that really could help you without any kind of pain. You just need to create a text document, where you store links to channels, videos, playlists you like and their names.</p>
	
		<p>After, you should disable comments and recommendations. Invidious can do this with a few settings.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Autoplay next video: off</li>
				<li>Default comments: none none</li>
				<li>Show related videos: off</li>
				<li>Default homepage: Search</li>
				<li>Feed menu: Search Search</li>
			</ul>

		<p>You should see nothing, but video and it's description. Don't worry, if you have a text document with your favorite channels and videos, you lose nothing, but have much more time for yourself.</p>
		
		<h3>Websites</h3>
		<p>Since this is the age of web applications and social media, people only use a few websites for their purposes. But if you would like to read some websites offline, it's a great idea to have a local copy of favorite websites and read them without Internet.</p>
		
		<p>You could use <a href='../documents/wget.txt'>wget</a>, or browser built-in webpage downloader.</p>
		
		<p>This could take much disk space, but you can store websites in a text document, like we are done with YouTube.</p>
	
		<h3>Explicit content</h3>
		<p>The Internet is full of adult and disgusting things. But explicit (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work'>nsfl</a>) content follows humanity through its history, so there is nothing special about this. Times change, and now we have websites specializing in this.<p>
	
		<p>During the teenage years, it is really hard to resist own body temptations, and can cause traumas like <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder'>PTSD</a>, but if you want to see less nsfw content, enable "safe search" in search engines.</p>
