	<img src="../images/Revelations.jpg" width="300px" height="300px" alt="Revelations" />
	<p>Maybe, it's the first time, when i start to see a real art inside album covers. It's being December 2019 - January 2020, i listen so much to Audioslave and Chris Cornell. I very good remember, when i play songs from this albums in Windows Media Center and just look at them, while listen to music.</p>
	
	<h2>Bring Me The Horizon - Count Your Blessings</h2>
	<img src="../images/Count Your Blessings.jpg" width="300px" height="300px" alt="Count Your Blessings" />
	<p>It is my favorite cover of all times, while i look at this cover, and it's booklet, i just feel yourself so happy, because this covers show, how beautiful can be things, that peoples create. All this luna parks, forests, and other thigs... i just cannot describe, how i like it...</p>
