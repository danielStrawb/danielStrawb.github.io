    <center><h1>Why i love Slackware so much?</h1></center>
    <p>If you read my blog, you can understand, that my favorite distro - it's Slackware, and here i list some reasons to try Slackware.</p>
    <center><h1>A big software collection</h1></center>
    <p>it's the biggest reason, just because i need less time to setting up system fully, now, in slackware 15.0 almost all programs, what i need is installed, it's just need to install PCManFM (Midnight Commander now is my main file manager, but PCManFM useful for me sometimes), Netsurf Browser (Slackware give you Firefox and SeaMonkey as default browser's), i3wm (Now i use WindowMaker, that system-default wm) (Slackware provide KDE Plasma or XFCE as standart DE, and 6 WM's), aMule, Torrent-client, and SMPlayer (Have many players by default, but that is the best player for me), that all, and my system is full ready to work.</p>
    <p>If you have programs, that you hate in basic Slackware bundle, you can past-install said installer to don't install them, as i do with Firefox, and SeaMonkey browser's.</p>
    <p>It's useful, when you need to install system in situation's, when  you can't connect device to Internet. With this plus of Slackware, i found so much cool and useful programs. It's have programs like mypaint-brushes, bundle of brushes for GIMP, EasyTAG, metadata editor, that i use before i found Slackware, SimpleScreenRecorder, and other...</p>
    <center><h1>Stability</h1></center>
    <p>Slackware is don't try to being progressive disto, he is trying to being stable and system, that work from install, that can be useful without Internet connection, you don't have the last version's of software, but you ever know, that you distro is don't broke without reason, and that's software not "ancient", it's really stable, and useful now.</p>
    <center><h1>Universal Distro</h1></center>
    <p>You can use Slackware as server-os, home-os, office-os, multimedia center, and you can find more ways to use Slackware, it's have a very huge program's list, for huge way's of use.</p>
    <center><h1>You know Slackware - you know Unix</h1></center>
    <p>Slackware don't make more abstraction's, like Debian with .deb, or RedHat with .rpm, Slackware packages - it's just tgz or txz archives, and you can manage packages with installpkg, removepkg, pkgtool, and slackpkg (mini package-manager to upgrade default installed packages). Slackware trying as it's possible to being like default Unix-like system.</p>
    <center><h1>A big collection of ScreenSaver's</h1></center>
    <p>Isn't is cool, to see animation's, if you leave you computer? It's better, than see a blank screen, and nothing more, if you think, that is take electricity, while you can leave for a long time, you can setting up in xscreensaver-settings time, when you computer is suspend, or shutdown. I set 15 minuite IDLE for screensaver's, and suspend after 60 minuites.</p>
    <center><h1>rc-scripts</h1></center>
    <p>It's have a collection of pre-installed rc-scripts, that located by <code>/etc/rc.d/</code>, and with them i can run as root scripts with system startup, like i do that with OpenVPN, cool thing, you should try it, if you need to do something like this. If you don't found what you need, you can write script yourself, it's just bash script, you can just write command, that need to exec with root at startup. For more information you can read comment's in script's code.</p>
