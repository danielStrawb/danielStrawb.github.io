    <center><h1>What i do to being productive and full of energy all day</h1></center>
    <p>I just want to give you hint's in something, i don't say, that is 100% variant, but it's work on my.</p>
    <center><h1>Trash Social Media</h1></center>
    <p>It's thing take the biggest part of you'r free time, i on myself understand, how that, when i have account in one social media, i every hour just refresh my feed to get new pack of content, that take my time, YouTube is work the same for me, and that's some way's to beat this:</p>
    <li>If you addicted to YouTube, choice the most important for you channel's, register new empty account on Invidious, and subscribe to this channel's, now just use SMTube with SMPlayer + mpv (Or in SMTube setting's you can choice you own player, VLC, MPlayer, and other, you easily can add player's, if need help, read <a href="./smplayer.html">my article about SMPlayer</a>), with them you don't have recommendation's under video, you just open video in player.</li>
    <li>Alternative way - just download important channel's on hard drive with youtube-dl or yt-dlp.</li>
    <li>If you have that function in smartphone, make limit for using social media, as example, 2 hour's a day.</li>
    <li>If you just chatting with friend's, ask they Messanger's, or eMail, maybe eMail can being a good alternative to modern messanger's, everyone have eMail, than XMPP.</li>
    <center><h1>Try my productivity application.</h1></center>
    <p>I write a simple program on C, you can <a href="https://codeberg.org/daniel5551/ProductivityRoll/">download it on my git-repo</a>,that just give you some activities for self-improvement, i take idea from <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.improvement_roll/">Improvement Roll</a> Android-application, but think, that it's too large for that simple task, and make my console-based version with my activities, but you can add you'r, by edit array with activities.</p>
    <center><h1>Stop visit porn-sites</h1></center>
    <p>Also take too much time, collect a lot of persoanl data, and way of social control, i don't recommend you to quit porn fast, in one attempt, i just can give you my way:</p>
    <li>Clear you bookmarks or other storage with porn from not interesting content.</li>
    <li>Download all content, that stay to local storage</li>
    <li>Put all in archive and encrypt with gpg, or password, make a strong password, and store password in notepad, not password database, or any other, that not so far from computer.</li>
    <li>Block pornsites with <a href="https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts">StevenBlack</a> or <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LukeSmithxyz/etc/master/ips">Luke Smith's</a> host's file.</li>
    <li>After some time you start understand porn as optional thing, and start to delete content from archive, the most important in this situation - DONT VISIT PORN SITES!</li>
    <p>Alternative way: Just delete all porn, and use imagination, if you felt, that you addicted to porn or masturbation, after this it's look's easy. It's better way, it's quick.</p>

    <center><h1>5. Take a notes</h1></center>

I'm have directory /Files/Notes/my_notes.txt, and to the most important thing's i'm add "!" in begin of note</p>
