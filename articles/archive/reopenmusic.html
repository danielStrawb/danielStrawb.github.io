    <center><h1>I think, i should review my relationship with music</h1></center>
    <p>I think, what i sould open something new in my favorite music, and analyze my music library.</p>
    <center><h1>What's wrong?</h1></center>
    <p>I have some reason, and the most important, it that i listen too much music with vocal, and music at all... Just let's look at my music library: about ~25GB, i have too much music, but i can live without it, music, that i usually listen, it's Alternative Rock of 2000's, and i love this music, but it's not good for work. I want to re-download my library, to have much more Ambient and Industrial (Like Nine Inch Nails, i never listen too much to this group, but i really proud of Trent Reznor), and other Experimental Music, i waste a lot time to just listening music, and do nothing, yes, i can work with Linkin Park or other music, but it's slow down's me, and i cannot concentrate. I  make some list, that contains music, that i want to have for work:</p>
    <center><h3>Songs</h3></center>
    <li>Bring Me The Horizon - Fifteen Fathoms, Counting</li>

    <p>I have much more music like this, but i don't know, is this good for work, not all of them without vocal, or have a powerful part's i add something, if remember music like this.</p>
    <br>
    <p>So, the first, that i need, is just make playlist with this music, or as i do on my smartphone, just unselect all folder's, that have music not in this list. It's being good not only for my work, it's being better for myself, i don't want to being addicted to music. Music like this give me more motivation and ideas for my music, i want to start make my musical album, but i don't have way to record my acoustic guitar, and i can't work with musical software, i need to impove myself in this. I really motivated of Trent Reznor and Beck, they are beautiful artist's, and legend's. I ready to give a lot time to this album, but i want, to people hear it, now i write lyric for my song's, but don't know, is my first really big work being with vocal, becuase i have a very bad voice, really. I also think, that i want to have 3 monitor's, i want to use middle as main, and other's for IDE and some movie's, or something like that, if i always have IDE on view, i think, that is increase my productivity.</p>
    <center><h3>If you think, that you have the same problem, let's try to do it together!</h3></center>
    <center><h1>Why i need to try this for myself?</h1></center>
    <p>I understand, that we cannot live without art, so you can do the same with any other art, movies, music or videogames, if you felt, that is don't give you happines. As example, now i just listen to music, for me it's hard to understand, what album is bad, or good, i just listen all, what i have, and riff's like in Kashmir become something default for me.</p>
    <h1>What i felt first day's</h1>
    <p>i don't know, maybe it's not about music, but now it's easily to concentrate for myself, finally, i just open IDE, and start edit/write code, as i love it, i really start to want learn something new, i still being 24/7 free, but now i have school, i can take more attension to education, and i want to do that last year's of my school. I felt, like i become more descipline, like i have less time to waste, sometimes i felt, like i just lying on bed, and do nothing, just watch YouTube, and it's being awful for me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>When i think about it, yesteday (02 Sep 2022) i think about to remove almost all trash from my life, like infinite memes, delete my old Invidious account, and subscribe only on intersting channels for me, unsubscribe from all channel's in Telegram and Discord, that don't give me real emotions speaking with peoples, that i love, and delete all software, that take my attension to unuseful information, and i don't said, that i want to don't feel yourself happy, i want only remove infinite waste of time, and spend all this time to more understand myself, study, and have a better fun.</p>
