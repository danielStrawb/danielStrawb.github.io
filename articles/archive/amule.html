 	<h1>Amule - Better, than Torrent?</h1>
	<p>Some time ago i talk in DigDeeper's XMPP chat, and we are talk about torrent's, gtk, qt, and he is reccomend me to try aMule. And, i think, that is a really cool alternative to torrent's.</p>
	<h2>What's wrong with torrent?</h2>
				<p>For me, the biggest problem being torrent trackers, you need to register, and pass moderation to get your file uploaded, that require too much time, to just upload file in public. Also, not all trackers can work in yoou country, with aMule you can upload file in second's, on you personal or public server, and only you control file. But anyway, i recommend to create you personal server, because in global search it's being hard to find you file, and sometimes in search results, in file names i see a really scary thing's, that illegal, so please, understand, what you downloading. If you upload, please add in file information as much as you can, subtitles languages, sound language, name of film/anime on multiple languages.</p>
	<h2>Have built-in search</h2>
	<p>It's one of the best thing, that aMule can do, it's have a built-in server list, and you can add your's. qBitTorrent have something like that, but it's not so good, as here, when you search in qBitTorrent, you make requests to multiple torrent trackers, in aMule you make requests only to one server, or servers in list, if you search with global search.</p>
	<h2>It's easier to upload files</h2>
	<p>As i said, you don't need to register on tracker's, and pass moderation, you just can copy or move in ~/.amule/Incoming, and choice name in aMule settings, if you want peoples to see, who are you, but it's optionaly.</p>
	<h2>CLI</h2>
	<p>You have acess to ed2k not only with GTK aMule, just type in terminal <code>ed2k</code>, and you have possability to download files from terminal.</p>
	<h2>But it's not so good</h2>
	<li>1. You cannot upload folder, you need to make archives</li>
	<li>2. You cannot download only part of files, you need to download all</li>
	<li>3. It's contain some illegal information, so being careful! It's being better to make your own server, only for you friend's or fans.</li>
