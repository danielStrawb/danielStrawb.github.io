    <center><h1>Debian is good for desktop</h1></center>
    <p>Before, i said, that i don't know a better Linux distro, than Slackware. But, it think, i being wrong. I understand, that i don't need 15GB of software, to feel yourself happy in offlice space. Last days, when i need to reinstall my OS, i have a lot of reinstalls, firstly i have some problem with Slackware and LILO/Grub installation, so install OpenBSD, but i have a lot of problems with it, and now i come to Devuan, with SysVInit, and, i impressed.</p>
    <h2>Have all basic for average person</h2>
    <p>I install Devuan with XFCE desktop, and it's perfect. It's design feel, that all software, that you have is made by one person. All is look simple, and have enough of software. It's have Links and Firefox as browsers, for offline space it's very good. You also have LibreOffice pre-installed, that's important for me. It's also have a set of videogames, include BSDGames, Midnight Commander, tmux, XScreenSaver, and fun things like CMatrix. For an average person it's easy to just download ISO image with all this pre-installed, write on USB, and use it.</p>
    <h2>Easier installation</h2>
    <p>Installing Debian, you have a lot less pain, than in Arch or Slackware at all, so any can use it, and Debian better, than Ubuntu.</p>
    <h2>A minimal space</h2>
    <p>You also have possability to install Debian with a minimal enviroment, and it's enough to use tty, nano, and something like this.</p>
    <h2>Samailar to Slackware software</h2>
    <p>When i install it, i feel yourself very comfy, i have fetchmail, mutt, mcabber, irssi, mc, htop, and links, so i don't need to install something more, i have all, what i need from computer. :)</p>
    <ceneter><h2>Conclustion</h2>
    <p>If you read my blog regular, you can see my recent post, called <a href="./uselesscomputers.html">Computers become useless</a>, you know, that now i want to minimize my work with it, so Debian - the best solution for this. I have a lot of space on my HDD, and have all my favorite programs. I still use it as my main OS, and think, that Slackware still good, but it's not for me now... I use Slackware, if i know, that i need to disconnect from Internet for a really long time.</p>
