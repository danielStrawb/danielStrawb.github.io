    <center><h1>Windows 7 - example of perfect OS design</h1></center>
    <p>A lot of peoples have nostalgia feeling about Windows 7, because it's become the first os of some peoples, it's os, that make a good feelings, associated with a good times, but i also want to show other side of this system - design.</p>
    <h2>Have enough to being perfect</h2>
    <p>It's os, where you don't know word "bloatware", you just have enough to:</p>
    <li>browse a minimal web, or html with Internet Explorer (Yes, maybe not the best variant for independent web, but it's good to just browse web-pages locally),</li>
    <li>Windows Media Player to listen to music, rip CD's and watch videos,</li>
    <li>tools for screenshots,</li> 
    <li>remote administration,</li>
    <li>WordPad as good alternative to Microsoft Word (At lease, it's basic functions),</li>
    <li>If you want to have fun, you have a lot of default videogames. Yes, it's simple, but is you need something more?</li>
    <h2>But why it's unique?</h2>
    <p>Just look at this beautiful design - yes, Aero is so cool. You can setting up your system look as you want, you have a few presets for a few topics, or you can design your system yourself, because you have a lot of screensavers, sounds and sound presets, wallpaper packs, gadgets, fonts. It's jsut system, that you want to explore and design. All this nature-style looks wonderful. Also, it's have som music, photos and video samples, that said to us, that this operating system makes with love, to give peopels some bonus content.</p>
    <h2>Every component is connected</h2>
    <p>Unlike Windows 10 or Windows 8, all have the same style, so you feel yourself comfortable.</p>
    <h2>Windows Media Center</h2>
    <p>It's just the best mediacenter, that i ever seen. Kodi or any other software cannot replace it. All this animations, categories, vizualizers, and other cool things make this software awersome, maybe it's the best reason to try Windows 7.</p>
