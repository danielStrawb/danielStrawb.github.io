    <center><h1>Tabs don't make you a good guitarist</h1></center>
    <p>I want to show you some view on guitar tabulature (or simply tabs), i think, that in future i make more articles about musical theory.</p>
    <h2>What wrong with tabs? Or this is good?</h2>
    <p>There is nothing wrong with tabs, it's a good way to make guitar easier, you don't need to learn musical notes, and note sheets to just play some songs, but many peoples thinks, that this is enough, and don't have progression in music, but they are have a good perspective.</p>
    <h2>You don't understand music, if you are play with tabs</h2>
    <p>When you are play music by tabs, you don't remember pregression of song, you just read numbers, you don't understand, how guitaris of you'r band make this riff/solo/chords. And honestly, i have notepad with tabs, to play, when i disconnected from electricity and Internet, and i cannot hear a song.</p>
    <h2>You don't train you'r ears</h2>
    <p>If you think, that "I just can't hear note", and if you listen to some Metal, maybe, yes, it's hardest, but me too cannot reconize note, my ears just remember sound of chords, because i don't read tabs usually, than i just play songs, while listen to music, and in 1 year, now I in second reconzie, that first chord in Creed - In America (I take this song, because it's the last song, that i play), it's A (La) (Barre), i also don't use metronome so usualy, i use my feet to count rythm.</p>
    <h2>Tabs can be incorrect</h2>
    <p>It's don't work only if song creator publish it yourself, or show on some live performance, like <a href="https://yewtu.be/watch?v=t0jT7NL5H7U">this</a>.</p>
    <h2>UltimateGuitar domination</h2>
    <p>Almost all tabs and chords stores at  UltimateGuitar, that require from you JS, have a lot of pop-ups, and cmmercial, that said you to buy paid-account on every step, and page. So, let's destroy it! Don't use UltimateGuitar, if you can! Use you personal website to post tabs.</p>
    <h2>But tabs not so bad, as i said</h2>
    <p>It's good, when you want to write song yourself, it's faster, to write riff with tabs, than write note sheets, but maybe better, if you have a lot of time, because you train note reading.</p>
	<h2>But is's not so important :)</h2>
	<p>If you just guitarist, that don't want to do something really big, and you just play for yourself and friend's - it's good way to play, i just write this article not just to give you some ideas, i also want to give you think, that you can make something bigger, like improvization. I'm also not perfect, and play with tabs too, but try learn something by ear, now i easily reconize chords, but it's harder for me to reconize notes. Just don't give up, and don't listen to some strangers, that said, that you are doing something wrong, there is no something right, just listen Beck's debut album. I recommend you also try to play some Blues licks and try to play Blues, it's really cool, and improve you. :D</p>
