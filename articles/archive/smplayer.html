    <center><h1>SMPlayer - The best multimedia player, that i use</h1></center>
    <p>If you read my blog, you can see, that i usually mention SMPlayer, or give you instructon's, where recommend to use him. And, now i want to give you some reason's, why it is.</p>
    <h2>Youtube support</h2>
    <p>SMPlayer is based on mpv/Mplayer, that give you possability to play Youtube, if you use mpv with youtube-dl/yt-dlp. And, it's not just support of Youtube-links, he have addon, that give you possability to surf Invidious, this addon called <a href="https://www.smtube.org/">SMTube</a>, and developed by author's of SMPlayer. As example, i use SMTube, and it's comfortable, you just need to login in Invidious, and you have acess to subscription's. Or, alternativly, you can use you own player, like MPlayer (It's have buil-in script, that give possability to play videos on it), mpv, VLC, and you can add you player's, SMTube can work without SMPlayer. (If you player can't play Youtube, remove "This player support video sites" and "This player can play online TV" in SMTube's player setting's).</p>
    <h2>Customization</h2>
    <p>It's the most customizable player with full interface, that i know, i can change position of toolbar, or use them like separated window, you can change content of control bar, or add more information about video in OSD (bottom bar), also, SMPlayer have a very cool function - it's have preset's of interface, as example, it's have Standart and Mini interface preset, you can use them, if you don't need too much from video, and you just want to have minimal control under video in interface, without toolbar, and detail control bar, OSD. Another setup, it's MPC - interface like Media Player Classic, famous player for Microsoft Windows, if you like them, you can try this preset, it's cool preset, but on my computer, it's have some control bar problem's, when enter full screen. And, "Skinnable GUI" - it's pack of unofficial preset's, that developed by other peoples. And, SMPlayer is have custom icon's, Gartoon and Default - it's my favorite. All that can be installed separetly, if you download "smplayer-themes" and "smplayer-skins" on <a href="https://www.smplayer.info/en/downloads">download page</a>. :)</p>
    <h2>Multimedia built-in categories</h2>
    <p>SMPlayer have built-in multimedia categories in "Open". As example, in "Radio" i add <a href="https://lainon.life/radio/swing.ogg.m3u">Lainchan Swing</a> station, and in TV i can add <a href="https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv">IPTV-org</a> IPTV list, and categorize this by country, language, and other... (Some note: if you create submenu (category), you need to edit them separetly, you can't move link's to subcategory, you need add them to subcategory).</p>
    <h2>Easy control playlist's</h2>
    <p>You can very easy change or create m3u/pls playlist's. As example, i make my <a href="../music/list.html">Youtube Music Playlist's</a> with SMplayer, and mentain them, i easily can suffle, or find element's in playlist, add some new element's, or directory content in two-three click's, without player restart. (Some note: If you use some special player setting's, while play playlist's, write run option's to "Settings > Advanced > MPlayer/mpv > Options", like "-speed 1.5", you can read about run parameter's in you player's documentation)</p>
    <h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>
    <p>In "Options" > "Keyboard and mouse" > "Load" you can load some preset's, like VLC-like shortcuts, or you can make shortcuts yourself, and save them.</p>
    <h2>Many other good mini-features</h2>
    <p>SMPlayer also have so much features, and i can't write them all in this article, but, i show you some features:</p>
    <li>Thumbnail Generator. (It's work like in MediaPlayer Classic)</li>
    <li>Tablet mode (Remove some features, and make font with button's bigger).</li>
    <li>Compact mode (Remove all interface, leave you just video box and context menu).</li>
    <li>Search Subtitles from native interface in <a href="http://www.opensubtitles.org/">opensubtitles.org</a>.</li>
    <li>Remember playback position for all files on computer (You can continue watch movie/video from moment, where you stop).</li>
    <li>You can send video to other screen. (As example, i connect notebook and my TV with HDMI, and i watch live performance's or musical video's on TV).</li>
    <li>Audio/Video equalizer.</li>
    <li>Make screenshot directly, while watch video.</li>
    <li>And many other...</li>
