    <center><h1>How to start learn music by ear</h1></center>
    <p>Before i make some article, where I said, that it's not so good to always learn music with tabs from other peoples. The main reason - you don't have progression in learning music by ear. That's really important thing, just because you cannot trust tabs, that created by stranger. Learning music by ear you understand structure of song. I'm not professional in this, but i can give you some tips for this, becuase i trust and use my own tabs and note sheets.</p>
    <h2>Try to play song in piano</h2>
    <p>Trying to reconize music by ear with piano is a lot easier, than with guitar, or other instruments. Just remember, that every note have it's unique sound, and C is sound different, than D. You can use application like <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/net.currit.tonality/">Tonality</a>. It's useful not only as piano simulator, with it you can learn music theory yourself. This is really must have for every music lover.</p>
    <h2>Slow down song</h2>
    <p>Useful not only for fast and energetic music, but also for soft and slow. When you have more time to think, you study and understand faster. It's also a great way to play music instrument, and learn songs. This with players like mpv and VLC, or if you want to learn only short song part - you can cut it with Audacity, and than play with this players. (Audacity can slow down track, but it's woks not so good).</p>
    <h2>Start from something easy, but your's favorite</h2>
    <p>I understand, how it's - want to play your favorite music, and sometimes we search the most easy way, but my profession as programmer shows me, that the easiest way - it's wrong way. Yes, you take a lot more time to learn song (Anyway, i don't think you learn the full song, beacuse almost all music is repeats, or notes just replaces with chords of the same note). And as i can say from my experience - i feel yourself happy of every chord that i reconize by ear. This feeling, when you finally play part that you learn with your favorite artist on background - it's just amazing, and not one tab can make me feel the same.</p>
    <h2>Start reconize from only one note</h2>
    <p>When you start something new - it's important to don't take so much on yourself. With music the same, you should start with reconize only one note, than take it in your memory, and move to next note. After some time you can take in memory more than one note.</p>
    <p>If you cannot found something easy from your's music, i can give you my list of songs that i reconize recently, try to play it yourself:</p>
    LukHash - PURE COINCIDENCE (It's being my first song, that i reconize by ear, so maybe it's good variant to start)<br>
    Deep Purple - Smoke On The Water<br>
 	Red Hot Chili Peppers - Around The World<br>
 	Linkin Park - Crawling<br>
 	Arctic Monkeys - Do I Wanna Know?<br>
