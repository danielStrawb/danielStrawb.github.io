	<h1>Why i love QTWebEngine/WebKit Browsers</h1>
	<div style="color: red">
		<h1>When i say "Browser", i talk about browser's on WebKit or QTWebEngine.</h1>
		<h1>GNU think's, that QtWebEngine - is non-free, because Blink is non-free.</h1>
	</div>
	<h1>1. It's simple to setting up and use</h1>
		<p>Browser's is easy to setting up, you don't need to edit the config, like in Firefox(Otter Browser has extanded functions, in about:config), to delete spyware (Browser's don't have spyware functions), or show hidden functions.</p>
	<h1>2. You have minimum problems, when surfing the Internet</h1>
		<p>QTWebEngine is based on Chromium Engine (Blink), and this is good, because for today, Google - is leader in Web Browser, and most of sites work best with Blink, and Blink is based on WebKit.</p>
	<h1>3. Don't need to install adblock</h1>
		<p>All of the famous Browser's have built-in AdBlock, that can work with ADB lists. Yes, it's can't be better, than uBlock Origin, but it's too not bad.</p>
	<h1>4. You can use proxy</h1>
		<p>Browser's have built-in proxy, and it's good, because Firefox browsers don't have it, and need to install extansion's.</p>
	<h1>5. Appearance settings</h1>
		<p>You can change mostly, of the interface elements. You can edit toolbar, edit default font's, change panel's position, install custom themes, or just disable all interface element's, and focus only on page.</p>
	<h1>6. You can use custom user-script's</h1>
		<p>You have possablility, to built-in you script, and use it. As example, i make a redirect to free front-end of the popular sites, like Invidious, and Libreddit. Also, you can use GreaseMonkey scripts, who have active community, and script's database on <a href="https://openuserjs.org">OpenuserJS</a>.</p>
	<h1>Bad Side's:</h1>
		<p>1. Don't have good JS-blocker</p>
			<p>Browser's don't have extansions like uMatrix, it can only disable JS on all sites, or enable it, where it need, and give some permisstion's limit to JS.</p>
