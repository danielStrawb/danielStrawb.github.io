    <center><h1>I know better alternative to Vim!</h1></center>
    <p>Hello! Today i want to said you about thing, that can be better, than Vim, have the same functional, don't need to learn many hotkeys, and can become you friend, while you work with computer!</p>		<h3>This is... MCEdit!</h3>
    <h2>Part of Midnight Commander (mc).</h2>
    <p>I don't understand that minimal file managers, if you really want minimalism, just use default UNIX-command's, but if you need more control under files, i recommend try that, if it's so important for you, mc listed in <a href="https://suckless.org/rocks">Suckless/Rocks</a>.<p>
    <p>If that's part of file manager, it's give you possability to easy switch by files, and manage. I don't have so much expiriance in dual-panel managers, almost all time i use PCManFM on Linux, and standart File Manager in Windows, and, when i try to prefare mc as main file manager, i understand, how fast i can do things, that can take minuites, half-hours of time in second's, or few minuites.</p>
    <h2>You don't need to remember something to being user of mc/mcedit</h2>
    <p>mcedit is have function-key hint's on the bottom panel, and you can press F9 to view all function's of editor. I don't need understand, that "dd" is delete line, i just press F8, if i forgot some function of unix-package, i can preess F11+m, write my program name, and i got manual in native mc interface, and many other function's like that, also have mouse support.</p>
    <h2>Same functional, and more!</h2>
    <p>Just take a look on the top-menu, by pressing F9, you can find a many function's, like in Vim, and many others, like macros, easy encoding switch, synatx hilight, search text/by regexp's, move function (yes, i just can move text section to other part of file!), bookmarks, and CLIPBOARD SUPPORT!</a>
    <h2>HTML-viewer</h2>
    <p>One of the best function of mc, i can view HTML as in text browser! Also, it's other raw-data format's support.</p>

    <h2>Preset's of code for programming language's.</h2>
    <p>Not all most popular languages, but some of them is have preset's of code, that located in "user menu" (F11), like if-else, switch, for, from languages that i use, i found only c and bash, maybe for someone it's being useful.</p>
    <h2>Work with other file</h2>
    <p>You can copy content of another file to current file, or copy content of current file to another, save time.<p>
    <h2>History support/file switch</h2>
    <p>Choice File > History in top menu, or press Alt+Shift+E to switch by files, can replace tab's in IDE or another text editor's, one more function, that Vim can't do.</p>
    <h2>Is this slower, than Vim?</h2>
    <p>Huh, no, i open file, that contain 172400 lines of text, and it's open in 1 second.</p>
