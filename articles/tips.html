		<h1>How to make your life feels better</h1>
		<p>Sometimes people work as hard as possible, and they are losing a joy of life. In todays world it's a really big problem, so I'll try to help you! ^_^</p>
		
		<h2>Workspace</h2>
		<p>You should feel happines, while working on your projects or just hobbies. Workplace should inspire you and nothing should distract you.<p>
		
		<p>Boredom is a natural motivation for improvements, find a way to take pleasure of boredom. When avoid distractions, I find myself programming, plying music by ear or simply writing note sheets, and I never get tired. Don't look for inspiration, just do, even 5 minuites a day!</p>
		
		<p>It's good to separate your working space, and space for art project, fun. I have a folders in my computer, and note-taking app:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fun</li>
			<li>Art-projects</li>
			<li>Study</li>
			<li>Other</li>
		</ul>
		<p>When i am about to take a break, i simply didn't open "study" folder. You are always should have some time for yourself.</p>
		
		<p>I have a backpack with my personal things, so I can easily find something in a single place. If I need to leave my house, I have everything in my backpack, and always have some free space for notebook and memories from my friends.</p>
		
		<h2>Disconnect!</h2>
		<p>We are waste SO much time in the network, that we cannot understand, how days go by, and then our life! But, can we also find some time for yourself?</p>

		<p>Disconnect from the network, turn off smartphone, and spend some time with yourself - try to understand, what's going on right now?</p>
		
		<p>Maybe, this is the moment, when you finally can complete videogame, play musical instrument, draw something, or maybe just revisit some of your old ideas and projects?</p>
		
		<p>Even a short time without permanent information flow help you to relax, or find some new idea, dream a little...</p>
		
		<p>Also, you can increase quality of the information you consume: if you are about to take a long-time break, it's better to watch something like <a href="https://www.masterclass.com/classes/deadmau5-teaches-electronic-music-production">deadmau5 Masterclass</a>, instead of Youtube-videos. Find pleasure in simple things!</p>
		
		<h2>Fun game</h2>
		<p>My friend showed me this simple paper game. Draw 6x5 Circles grid, and paint some objects around them. This is a good way to kill some time.</p>

		<p>And this is my example: <a href='../images/my_example.jpg'>picture</a>.</p>
