		<h1>My favorite album covers</h1>

		<img src="../images/Revelations.jpg" width="300px" height="300px" alt="Revelations" />
		<p>Maybe, it's the first time, when i start to see a real art inside album covers. It's being December 2019 - January 2020, i listen so much to Audioslave and Chris Cornell. I very good remember, when i play songs from this albums in Windows Media Center and just look at them, while listen to music.</p>
		
		<h2>Bring Me The Horizon - Count Your Blessings</h2>
		<img src="../images/Count Your Blessings.jpg" width="300px" height="300px" alt="Count Your Blessings" />
		<p>It is my favorite cover of all times, while i look at this cover, and it's booklet, i just feel yourself so happy, because this covers show, how beautiful can be things, that peoples create. All this luna parks, forests, and other thigs... i just cannot describe, how i like it...</p>

		<h2>Daft Punk - Discovery</h2>
		<img src="../images/Discovery.jpg" width="300px" height="300px" alt="Discovery" />
		<p>It's colors on logo seems for me to candies. :P</p>
	
		<h2>HITNECK RECORDS - ブチギレハードコア</h2>
		<img src="../images/Crossfade.png" width="300px" height="300px" alt="Crossfade" />
		<p>It's very cool cover for me. It's only one character on it with middle finger up, and look's really cool, and can said about music, that contains this album.</p>
		
		<h2>Underoath - They’re Only Chasing Safety</h2>
		<img src="../images/They’re Only Chasing Safety.jpg" width="300px" height="300px" alt="They’re Only Chasing Safety" />
		<p>Before, i was writing about <a href="./memories.html">some episode</a> of my life, that connects me with this album cover. But, this is not the only reason. When i firs seen this cover, when i was looking for some music on Topster, from the collection of thausand albums, this cover will take my attension in a seconds. I was never though, that simple picture like that can look inside my soul. When Underoath record this album, they are have no money for some colorful picture, and the photographer just took photo of his wife, and i think, that almost after 20 years, this is just one of the greatest cover ever made. Like usually, accidental thing will give the genius result.</p>
