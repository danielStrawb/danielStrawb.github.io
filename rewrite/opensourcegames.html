    <h1>A Good Free and Opensource Video-Games</h1>
		<h2><a href="https://www.minetest.net/">Minetest</a></h1>
		<p>Minetest - it's a good game, based on Minecraft idea. I love it, because it have <a href="https://content.minetest.net/">Officila mod's/textures/and game's database,</a>  and you can install it directly from game, update, and play. It's game good for you, and you friends, you can play together on Linux, Windows, Android, *BSD, and MacOS, no limit's, like in Minecraft with Java and Bedrock edition. If you want to play minigames, it's game have some public servers with minigames, i recommend you <a href="https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=14480">this server</a>. Game don't have habitual for Minecraft-player item's, like mobs, or redstone, but you can add it with mod's, or find server with pack of mod's. And last reason to play - <a href="http://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-games.html">GNU is recommend Minetest against Minecraft</a>. If you just want to build something or survive, it's perfect game for you!</p>
		<p>I recommend you to install <a href="https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/mineclone2/">Mineclone 2</a> or <a href="https://git.minetest.land/MineClone5/MineClone5">Mineclone 5</a>, if you want to play Minecraft-like game.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://www.openra.net/">OpenRA</a></h1>
		<p>It's my the most favorite video-game series ever, when i'll be young, i usually play in Command and Conquer game's, and i recommend you to play Now it's beta test of Tiberian Sun. It's cool, because game is not stop on pack of three games, and expand it with time.</p>
		<h2><a href="https://www.urbanterror.info/home/">Urban Terror</a></h1>(Closed Source Game, but have reasons to be here)
		<p>The best alternative to Counter Strike. And, it's fun to play with games, my friend in life, that complete a many good games said, that is cool game, and, it's not hard game, i don't play shooters about 2 years, and i don't dead usually, in that game also easier to make bunnyhop, and, this game take some part's from Team Fortress, like medic's, CTF. Game don't have imbalance gun's, and also i see sometimes map's from Counter Strike in this game, maybe it's can be full replace for Counter Strike, becuase first version's is too old for today's computer's, and new version is have soo much thing's, like casino, skin's, and DRM, you also can play with <a href="https://www.urbanterror.info/support/188-game-bots/">bot's</a>.</p>

		<h2>Free Old Games</h1>
		<p>On <a href="https://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> you can found a big collection of source's, and asset's of classic games, like Duck Nuckem, Quake, Doom, and many other games. You just need to run this from custon engine, like GZDoom for Doom, JFDuke for Duke Nuckem and other.</p>
		<h2>Extra: Way to Play With Opensource software and DRM-free</h1>

But when you complete registration, it's don't need more. And about Opensource- some time ago, i find <a href="https://sharkwouter.github.io/minigalaxy/">Minigalaxy</a> <a href="https://github.com/sharkwouter/minigalaxy">[Github mirror]</a>, opensource client for Linux, i reccomend to use it.</p>
