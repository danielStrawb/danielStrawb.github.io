		<h1>Fun videogames to play with friends</h1>
		<p>Did you remeber times, when you are play videogames together with friends, maybe in one room? I think, everyone have that great feeling, so maybe it's time to come back to episodes, when videogames connect people. This list is based on my personal memories and thoughts, so maybe you can not found your's favorite multiplayer games, but feel free to write me, and give me some more fun games.</p>
		
		<h2>Minecraft</h2>
		<p>Really, maybe the only game, that don't lose it's popularity for 15 years. People still play, and make a thausand ways to have fun. Sadly, last few years Java Minecraft have very sad episodes. Servers like HiveMC and Mineplex closed, they are don't have possability to play with other players of Bedrock Minecraft. But, recently i play with my old internet-friends on their private server for Minecraft version 1.5.2, and, this is really incredible feeling, like i come back in my 2017-2018, when we are have fun almost every day, chatting in Discord. So yes, maybe if you are get tired of games you play, maybe you should try to come back to this classic, new versions, or maybe old? Like old have more possabilities to create, but new have a fantastic adventures!</p>
		
		<h2>Minetest</h2>
		<p>But, also we shouldn't forget about opensource projects. Minetest is just one of the best opensource videogame projects, so anyone can play it, on mobile phones, or computers. Minetest in it's vanilla representation looks like old Minecraft versions, that give you more ways to have fun by yourself, or just create some art.</p>
		
		<h2>Left 4 Dead</h2>
		<p>I rearly play this videogame, but it's just one of my the most favorite games ever. I think, there is impossible to imagine game, that have something more, than Left 4 Dead. You have a company, achivements, online mode, steam workshop content, and really big collection of extra modes, that just don't give you a reason to be bored even after thausand hours of gameplay.</p>
		
		<h2>Portal 2</h2>
		<p>A game of my childhood, and another masterpiace from Valve. You have jsut the same things: singleplayer, achivements, co-op, workshop content, and bonus content, but now you are should solve logical puzzles, or just have fun with <a href='https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=96685421'>Minecraft map</a>. This scince-fiction setting give us a really great story, with cool soundtrack, really famous characters, like GlaDOS, Chell, and this two robots from co-op.</p>
		
		<h2>UnCiv</h2>
		<p>This is an opensource Civilization-like videogame. Comparing to Sid Meier's game, it's really simple, but the same time have the same mechanics as Civilization. I play it only once with my friend, other time i spend in singleplayer, and it's not so fun, but a really good way to kill time.</p>
		
		<p>The reason i didn't include Civilization VI here, because of it's DLC policy. They are just split one videogame by small DLC's, that add only a few new civilizations or mechanics. But, this game just being one of the greatest event of my 2020, when i spend time with my brother and Internet-friends playing this game, and don't care about anything.</p>
		
		<h2>Pony Town</h2>
		<p>It's an online chat, that made in a style of videogame. Here is you could find some interesting people to play with, or just have fun. For me, this is just one of the best ways to relax, because it's game style really beautiful, this map is full of content, and you have a few servers for different regions, so you always could found people to talk with. Anyway, sadly most of game's community is teenagers in age of 10-12, so maybe you being bored a little.</p>
		<p>Also, i can say, that their composer <a href='https://wanderingartist.bandcamp.com/'>Wandering Artist</a> is just fantastic artist, i am enjoy listening to his music, even if i don't play Pony Town, i always have his discography on my phone, so i also recommend to enjoy this music, if you try to play Pony Town.</p>

		<p><i>Someone is try to copy my pony, and then other people do the same thing, so in past i've have my personal pony-army :D</i></p>
		
		<h2>Stardew Valley</h2>
		<p>My brother showed me this game, and since this time, i was fell in love with this setting, game mechanics, and other minor things, that make this game not only way to have fun, but also a gret way to relax, looking for some interesting places on map, making own farm or just fishing. Honestly, just one of the greatest Indie games ever. Anyway, not for me, just because i cannot waste so much time on videogames, but with friends it's a lot better!</p>
