	<h1>Making a local APT repository with Debian ISO</h1>
	<p>In this guide, i show you, how you can easily become independent from APT repositories from Internet, having only Debian or Devuan ISO-file.</p>
    <h2>Downloading</h2>
    <p>I show this on Devuan, because it's having a <a href="https://www.devuan.org/get-devuan">DESKTOP</a> image, with 4 GB of packages.</p>
    <h2>Preparing enviroment</h2>
    <p>We are need to mount this ISO. If you have a free USB Media, you can write Devuan on it, with <code>dd</code>, but you can just write <details><code>mount ./*Path to ISO* ./*directory to mount*</code></details> <br> And, that's all.</p>
    <h2>Using as repository</h2>
    <p>And, the last, that we need - it's write path to /etc/apt/sources.list. Write something like this: <details><code>deb [trusted=yes] file:/*Path to mount directory* chimaera main contrib</code></details> <br> It should like something like that: <code>deb [trusted=yes] file:/media/cdrom chimaera main contrib</code>.<br>Now, updating with <code>sudo apt update</code>. And, now you can disable other repos.</p>
