	<h1>Independence in the digital world</h1>
	<p>We are live in the digital age, and we are use smartphone, computer, TV and other gadgets to simplify personal life, but sometimes we are losing control.</p>
	
	<h2>TV</h2>
	<p>I see not so much interesting and just fun programs on TV, so I'd prefer to don't watch TV at all. Almost every program could be found on the Internet.</p>
	
	<p>But, TV is good as an extra screen for computer or game console. You could buy HDMI/HDMI cable.</p>
	
	<p><b>It's also useful advice for those, who travel a lot, because hotel rooms usually have a TV.</b></p>
	
	<p>With time i've seen less and less really interesting shows on TV, most of my channels list are some news with propaganda, or infinite reality shows, and serials, so i don't watch TV as usually as in childhood. I prefare to just download live performances or films on my usb flash drive, and watch it without any commercials, and can pause it at any time, resume my progress at any day.</p>
	
	<h2>Fast Food</h2>
	<p>As a person from the countryside, I never understood the meaning of fast food. This is a massive industry, and I just cannot imagine, how people could kill so many animals in a cruel to just eat some junk food.</p>

	<p>On the Internet you could find so many websites with cooking topic. It's easier and healthier to make food by yourself. <a href='https://based.cooking/'>Based Cooking</a></p>
	
	<h2>Internet</h2>
	<p>When I study at school, I always see students spend their time with smartphone. They do nothing, but just watch TikTok's, and wait for the next class, then going home and play video games.</p>
	
	<p>In this situation, it's really hard to find friends or just discuss something.</p>
	
	<p>I cannot write everything about <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_addiction_disorder'>Internet addiction</a>, but I want you to understand this.</p>
	
	<q>donâ€™t browse the web and actually get some work done</q> - <a href="http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/firefox">cat-v</a>
	
	<h3>Self-Analysis</h3>
	<p>We should understand more about our activities, where we spend time the most. Install open-source software <a href='https://activitywatch.net/'>Activity Watch</a> and modules <a href='https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-afk'>aw-watcher-afk</a>, <a href='https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-window'>aw-watcher-window</a> with <a href='https://github.com/ActivityWatch/aw-watcher-web'>aw-watcher-web</a> browser extension.</p>
	
	<p>This help me to understand, that I spend about 3-5 hours a day with my devices. Most of the time I just talk with my friends, or watch some videos, maybe play video games. This reduced my anxiety about my screen time.</p>
	
	<h3>Google/Apple account</h3>
	<p>The best way to store personal information - it's to buy a few usb flash drives. Anyway, sometimes we are want to send some large file, or have a good email service. Google or Apple are not the best.</p>
	
	<p>I recommend <a href='https://disroot.org/'>Disroot</a>. I use their service for years, and have no problems. They are give 2 GB of free disk space and I think it's enough for personal use.</p>
	
	<h3>Messengers</h3>
	<p>I dislike messengers, they are requiring you to always have smartphone to use them. Some messengers now looks like social media, with short videos and news channels.</p>
	
	<p>I prefer to talk with social media messages. Almost every social media have its own messenger included. Everyone have account in at lease one social media. Discord is the only fine messenger for myself.</p>
	
	<p>If you are use social media only to contact with friend, there is nothing harmful. This is a way healthier to use Internet, if you check messenger a few times a day, than every time you took a smartphone to check new messages. Some social media could also disable news feed./p>
	
	<p>The day I deleted Telegram been one of the most important of this year. I finally get rid of this habit of checking my phone every morning, or if I just took it to my hands. My life will now more relaxed and silent, like there is no spontaneous notifications anymore.</p>
	
	<h3>YouTube</h3>
	<p>Last years I cannot enjoy watching YouTube, and I find less and less interesting and useful content. YouTube has evolved from some fun place to a big commercial platform. Videos become a way more serious, and less funny.</p>
	
	<p>But the same time, it's become more addictive, to just wasting time watching some videos to just fill background.</p>

	<p>I find some simple hack, that really could help you without any pain. You just need to create a text document, where you store links to channels, videos, playlists you like and their names.</p>

	<p>After, you should disable comments and recommendations. Invidious can do this with a few settings.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Autoplay next video: off</li>
			<li>Default comments: none none</li>
			<li>Show related videos: off</li>
			<li>Default homepage: Search</li>
			<li>Feed menu: Search Search</li>
		</ul>

	<img src='../images/Screenshot Invidious.png'>
	<p>You should see nothing, but video and it's description. Don't worry, if you have a text document with your favorite channels and videos, you lose nothing, but have much more time for yourself.</p>
	
	<h3>Websites</h3>
	<p>Since this is the age of web-applications and social media, people use only a few websites for their requirements. But if you like to read some websites, like mine, it's a great idea to have a local copy of favorite websites and read them without Internet.</p>
	
	<p>You could use <a href='../documents/wget.txt'>wget</a>, or browser built-in webpage downloader.</p>
	
	<p>This could take much disk space, but you could just store websites in a text document, like we are done with YouTube.</p>

	<h3>Explicit content</h3>
	<p>The Internet is full of adult and disgusting things. But explicit (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work'>nsfl</a>) content follows humanity through its history, so there is nothing special about this. Times change, and now we have websites specializing in this.<p>

	<p>During the teenage years, it is really hard to resist own body temptations, and can cause traumas like <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder'>PTSD</a>, but if you want to see less nsfw content, try to enable "safe search" in DuckDuckGo. Bing also haves a good safe search option.</p>
