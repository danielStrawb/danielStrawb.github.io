	<h1>How To Sell Nostalgia</h1>
	<p>Last time, i usually see some internet-videos, related to nostalgia. Someone is shows videogames we play in childhood, music, youtube-videos, and other related things. Usually, on background we can hear music from Minecraft.</p>
	
	<p>And i start to think about, that someone have profit from creating this videos. We have communities related to this memories. And this give me some ideas, that almost all of this feelings is fake: When i listen to Minecraft music, i feel nothing, but beauty, that hidden behind this simple and minimalistic music, but i can underatand this in a years, after i start to learn music theory, and i never have feelings, like time has passed, and i lost something.</p>
	
	<p>Playing command & Conquer and Minecraft, usually i just enjoy videogames, and i still play on the same maps, doing the same things, listening to the same background music, i don't feel this sadness for the past, i just like to spend my time in this simple but fun games.</p>
	
	<p>And the same time, similar videos, and culture movements, like Dreamcore and Frutiger Aero, maybe they are trying to express this emotions in art, but the same time they are want attract some attension, creating some fake feelings, that send them to their childhood. It's profitable not only creators, but platfomas like TikTok, that creates some trends for this.</p>
	
	<p>There is nothing bad, to remember the good moments of life, because usually this things inspire us to move forward. But all this concern of the past creates some kind of "addiction", when today's life is look like something worse, than the past. Many people says, that we are remember only the best from the past, so our memories distorts in some warm feelings, but i think this is wrong idea.</p>
	
	<p>What we want to have, when we are remember of the past, childhood? We want a simple life, where relationship with others is easier, where we are happy with out family, in warm and comfy house. Usual, this is wish of people, that lost someone, or made a mistake in the past, and i want to say - but all is not lost yet.</p>
	
	<p>If we want a simple life, why can't we create it? Give up all the political, ethnical and other beliefs, lifestyle. Since we've been in childhood, so much things come to our head, and almost all of this are simply useless.</p>
	
	<p>Smoking, alcohol and drugs are one of that things, that destroy this world simplicity. Almost all of my friends and family members is smoking, and this is just one of the most terrible things. I know, how this is, start to smoke in 12, and still do the same in 42. I hope, no one of my followers face it, and give up every bad habit.</p>
	
	<p>This is my personal experiance, because i face all i write in this article. But now, i am just refuse almost all of my beliefs, come back to my old friends, and got some new, and now i am really happy, even recently i lost some important people.</p>
	
	<p>I am also like to play videogames of my childhood, and listen to music. Albums like LukHash - Digital Memories and She - Aspire create that feeling, and come back me in the past, because this albums is connected to my life, but i see in this music composer ideas, so this albums great at all.</p>
	
	<p>The same i feel listening to early Skrillex (My Name is Skrillex - Bangarange EP). This albums also follow me a long path, but if you try listen to music, give up all memories, you see a really beautiful in all kinds music.</p>
	
	<p>Skrillex don't make music, waiting, that everyone understand him after 15 years, he just do this for fun. And after time, it's give some profit, and he become symbol of his time, inspire many people.</p>
	
	<p>Nostalgia - it's the same feeling, like sadness, happiness, and this inspire us the same way to create some great things. I usually like to take a break from Internet, and feel yourself like in childhood, when i have fun as i want, like taking a walk, or use computer, and forgot about anything bad. You shouldn't forgot of this feeling, and be happy, that you have such beautiful moments in life...</p>
