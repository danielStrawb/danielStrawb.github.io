	<h1>Ways to contact with me</h1>
	
	<h2><a href="./contacts.html" title="Version for Russian-native peoples">Русская версия</a></h2>
	
	<p>This page helps you to find a few methods to write me a message, and take some dialogue with me.</p>
	
	<h2>eMail</h2>
	<p>It's the most comfy way to write me. Everyone have eMail. This method support offline messages.</p>
	<p>My address: <a href="mailto:danielafanasev@disroot.org"><strong>danielafanasev@disroot.org</strong></a></p>
	
	<h2>IRC</h2>
	<p><abbr>IRC</abbr>, Internet Relay Chat - it's very simple and minimal way to chat. To use it, you should only enter your's nickname. I am always availible at server <strong>irc.nk.ax/6667</strong>. You can find me at rooms #chat-ru and #chat by nickname <strong>jni</strong>.</p>	
	
	<h2>XMPP</h2>
	<p>XMPP maybe one of the best alternative to messangers. So, i think you feel yourself pretty comfortable here. If you don't have account at XMPP, i recommend you to use <a href="https://disroot.org/services/xmpp">Disroot</a>'s provider service. They are also have a lot other services, like cloud storage, mail service, and other software to take some collective work.</p>
