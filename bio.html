	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>Hello! My name is Daniil, i am 17 years old, and this is my website. I am writing here about my thoughts and hobbies.<p>
	
	<p><b>I hope you enjoy my posts!</b></p>

	<h2>Website history</h2>
	<p>In September 2021, i've been really bored, so i started documenting my life. First, i write only about video games, computers, and privacy, but later i start writing about everything interesting to me, like music.<p>
	
	<h2>My hobbies</h2>
	<p>I am a minimalist and a perfectionist, so usually i find myself rewriting articles because they're not simple enough.</p>
	
	<p>I write some simple software, and play musical instruments: an acoustic guitar and a melodica.</p>

	<p>When i want to take a break, i take almost anything in my hands, like drawing.</p>
	
	<p>I like to listen to alternative rock, experimental, and electronic music. And the most influential artists are:</p>
	<ul>

		<li>The Rasmus</li>
		<li>Keiko Matsui</li>
		<li>Acoustic Labs (GC Johnson)</li>
		<li>Beck Hansen</li>
	</ul>
		
	<p>I want to create a comfortable place for my readers as if they are at home.<p>
